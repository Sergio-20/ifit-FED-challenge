# Opening

Thank you for taking the time to read this! I really appreciate taking time out of your day to evaluate my work!

## Tools used to turn the mockup into code:

HTML, CSS, Javascript, Sass (SCSS), jQuery, jQuery slideIn.js, and React were used for the iFit FED Challenge. Also the extension, Prettier, was used to keep the code clean in regards to its alignment and extra space.

## CSS Objectives Completed

1. Animate and fade in hero text
2. Animate cards in the grid section on hover
3. Animate and fade in cards in the iFit-enabled equipment section, when in view.

## Javascript Objectives Completed

1. Set up the language picker in the footer to "select" different languages (display a list of languages and replace the label when clicked)

### Time To Complete

In total this took about a day and a half for the work I completed.

## Finished Result

***Note: These are screenshots that were taken as I scrolled down. That is why there appears to be white space/image issues when there are not any issues.***
